    "- Hypothesis: People earning less money could be younger, and would travel to their parent's houses for Thanksgiving. People earning more are more likely to have Thanksgiving at their house as a result\n",
    "- Conclusion: The data supports the above hypothesis. for incomes below 50000, 38% of respondents are staying home, whereas for incomes over 150000, 48% of respondents are staying home. The more income, the more likely Thanksgiving will be happening at home.  "
